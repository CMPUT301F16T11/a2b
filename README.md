username and hit sign in. The app will automatically load into a map view and center on your 
current location. You'll notice by the top of the screen that you're in rider mode. 

Rider mode: 
	You can make ride requests by choosing (or searching) two separate places on the map 
	and using the button in the bottom right corner to set them and initiate a request. 

	A suggested fair fare will already be filled out for you, but feel free to change this. 
	You can view requests you've made (and various other categories of requests) by clicking 
	on the three dots menu in the top right corner and hitting View Requests. You can 
	also view/edit your profile and change to driver mode in this menu

Driver Mode:
	You can select a search radius, search for new requests and also view/accept requests from 
	the map visually or in the same view requests view as there is for riders. 

Request Details:
	When you've selected a request from the request details page you can view it's current status, 
	confirmed driver (if any), the rider, the start and end locations (click them to view on map)
	and a list of drivers who've accepted the request. From here various actions like payment, 
	confirming a driver, accepting a request, completing a request are avaiable based on the 
	ownership and state of the request.
