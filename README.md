Welcome to a2b, a CMPUT301 project! 


** Please Note **
Older Android emulators have problems sending location. While the app 
run fine on the emulator, the current location may not work. We        
recommend using the app on emulator sdk 24 and above. The assignment
required functionality will run on 18 and above, however for the full experience we recommend 24 and above.           

If you want details on this issue and how to get it working on older APIs, 
this guide details it: 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19372399/running-google-map-application-on-android-emulator

Running on lab machines:
Please note our maps api uses google play services so please install the newest version of google play 
service from sdk manager, it is under extras. After this point you must create an emulator at least of
api 18 that has google api(or else the map wont render). Here are some simple tips to get our project 
running on emulator in the lab machine. After you have this emulator set up please change the jdk path
to: /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle. This is done by going file-> Project Structure-> Sdk location-> Jdk path and 
then changing that path to /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle.


Permissions required: 
	Location 

If you don't have an account click sign up when you load the app. Otherwise simply enter your 
username and hit sign in. The app will automatically load into a map view and center on your 
current location. You'll notice by the top of the screen that you're in rider mode. 

Rider mode: 
	You can make ride requests by choosing (or searching) two separate places on the map 
	and using the button in the bottom right corner to set them and initiate a request. 
	A suggested fair fare will already be filled out for you, but feel free to change this. 
	You can view requests you've made (and various other categories of requests) by clicking 
	on the three dots menu in the top right corner and hitting View Requests. You can 
	also view/edit your profile and change to driver mode in this menu

Driver Mode:
	You can select a search radius, search for new requests and also view/accept requests from 
	the map visually or in the same view requests view as there is for riders. 

Request Details:
	When you've selected a request from the request details page you can view it's current status, 
	confirmed driver (if any), the rider, the start and end locations (click them to view on map)
	and a list of drivers who've accepted the request. From here various actions like payment, 
	confirming a driver, accepting a request, completing a request and submitting payment
	are avaiable based on the ownership and state of the request. 

View Profile: 
	Here profile information of a user is shown. If you are logged into the account you are 
	currently viewing, you can edit the email and phone number associated with your account. 
	If you are viewing another users profile, you can tap their phone number or email to call
	or email them. 

While Offline: 
	You can view the map in rider mode in your current locale (currently Edmonton only). 
	You can set requests to automatically be sent when you reconnect to the internet. 
	Please select "update data" in the three-dot menu in the top right corner to force an update. 
	In driver mode, you can view requests you've already accepted and accept new ones to be updated
	when you are online again (by the same procedure).

	Design patterns:
	Singleton
		- UserController: One static instance of User that gets set on sign in is shared by all
		activities.

	Builder pattern
		- Jests Builder classes are used to build commands that are executed by the JEST client
		- When app is in offline mode, instructions are created and and put on a command stack 
		that is to be executed when connectivity has been regained. This updates updates the
		info on the server.
		-RiderNotificationService and DriverNotificaton system utilize the Android notification builder 

	Templepate pattern
		- App takes advantage of the hooks provided by Activity class 

	Addapted pattern
		- Addapted OSM map tiles to work with the google maps APIs
	
	Proxy pattern
		- Used the proxy pattern for representing full UserRequests when the user was not online.
		Full UserRequests were substitued in when the user came back online and more information 
		was avaiable. 

	State pattern
		- User held state information, whether a user was a currently a driver or a rider. 
		- Request held state information, whether a user was unaccepted, accepted, confiremed, i
		nprogress, completed, payment recived.
		- App held state informatoion, whether or not it was to operate in offline or online mode.

	Decorator pattern
		- ShadedListAdapter makes use of a decorator pattern
