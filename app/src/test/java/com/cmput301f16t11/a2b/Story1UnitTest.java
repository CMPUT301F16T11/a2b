        Based on US 01.01.01
        Billy is in a rush. It's -30 degree Celsuis outside and his car won't start because
        he left the radio on overnight. He has a big meeting in about thirty minutes and no
        time to waste. He remembers that last night he downloaded and signed up for the next
        "big thing app," at the request of his friends. He loads up a2b on his phone and requests
        a ride from his current location, his house, to his workplace. Billy is an excellent example
        of an average a2b user with an average request.

         Testable items:
            Billy login
            Open new request
            Enter start location : home
            Enter end location : work
            Enter fare
