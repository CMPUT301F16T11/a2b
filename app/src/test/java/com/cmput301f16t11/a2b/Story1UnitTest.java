        Use Case: 1
        Id: US 01.01.01
        Description: A casual rider's car will not start and is in a rush to arrive.
        He uses a2b by selecting the start and end locations for the trip, and then
        requesting a ride between those two locations.

        Primary Actor: The casual rider
        Supporting Actor(s): Any drivers considering the request
        Goal: To submit a request for a ride between the two locations to the a2b system.
        Pre-conditions:

        App has access to the internet.
        Post-conditions:

        A request between the two locations is submitted to a2b servers.
        Basic Flow:

        1 The (logged in) rider selects a starting location
        2 The rider selects an end location
        3 The rider submits the request (with a fare offer?)
        Exceptions:

        1 - If there is no internet connection, system displays an error, loops to step 1 (eventually will use use case 21 instead - v2.0?)
