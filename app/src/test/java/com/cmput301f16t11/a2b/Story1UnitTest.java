public class Story1UnitTest {
    /*
Use Case: 1
Id: US 01.01.01
Description: A casual rider's car will not start and is in a rush to arrive.
He uses a2b by selecting the start and end locations for the trip, and then
requesting a ride between those two locations.

Primary Actor: The casual rider
Supporting Actor(s): Any drivers considering the request
Goal: To submit a request for a ride between the two locations to the a2b system.
Pre-conditions:

App has access to the internet.
Post-conditions:

A request between the two locations is submitted to a2b servers.
Basic Flow:

1 The (logged in) rider selects a starting location
2 The rider selects an end location
3 The rider submits the request (with a fare offer?)
Exceptions:

1 - If there is no internet connection, system displays an error, loops to step 1 (eventually will use use case 21 instead - v2.0?)
