To remove any duplicate tests some methods in the unit tests have been 
removed. The following is a list of the current working tests in each file/US. 

Since some parts of the stories involve similar procedures, duplicate tests 
are removed. 

This list exists for an easier visualization of any possible duplicate tests.
