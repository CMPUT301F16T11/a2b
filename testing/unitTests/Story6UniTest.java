/* Based on US 01.06.01
   Raine is an extremely successful real estate agent. Part of her 
   success comes from arranging rides for clients who do not have 
   their own transportation to prospective properties. While she 
   can usually drive her clients, sometimes she gets them to use an 
   app like a2b to pick them up on the promise of later reimbursement. 
   She needs to see which service generally offers the most reasonable 
   fares. She brings up a2b and tests a few different locations for 
   trips for a fair fare estimate on each. Raine is an example of a 
   power user, but she is using functionality that an average user would 
   also use.
